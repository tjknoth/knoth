I'm a first year PhD student at UCSD working with the [Programming Systems Group](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/progsys/).

I did my undergrad in Computer Science and Mathematics at Grinnell College in Iowa. I worked on high-speed GPU algorithms for order statistic selection with [Dr. Jeffrey Blanchard](http://www.math.grinnell.edu/~blanchaj/).
