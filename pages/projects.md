I'm interested in leveraging programming languages to make programming easier and more accessible.

### GPU Multiselection
Selecting order statistics is a ubiquitous problem in big data analysis. Choosing only 101 or 1001 uniformly distributed order statistics is extremely informative about the overall distribution of the dataset. Existing algorithms to solve this are either slow (like the naive sort-and-choose approach) or imprecise (like various bootstrapping-based algorithms). By using a distributed network of GPUs we can select multiple order statistics from datasets on the order of 2<sup>28</sup> without approximation.
